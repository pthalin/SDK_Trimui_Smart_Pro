# Patched SDK and sysroot for Trimui Smart Pro

Based on the official files from Trimui

Changes

    Patched to fix incorrect sysroot lib and include paths.

NOTE: This file includes both toolchain and sysroot. It has absolute paths so it must be unpacked so it is in "/opt/aarch64-linux-gnu-7.5.0-linaro".
